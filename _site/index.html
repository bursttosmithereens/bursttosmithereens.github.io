<p>For two intense years, our team of three remained devoted to Meraki Lab on a full-time basis. However, as we embarked on our individual paths towards graduate degrees, we recognized the need to strike a balance between academia and entrepreneurship. The pursuit of advanced degrees has further equipped us with a broader skill set and a deeper understanding, strengthening our ability to overcome hurdles and drive innovation. Though our availability has become limited, we remain committed to nurturing our projects, determined to continue making meaningful contributions to the AI landscape.</p>

<p>As we embark on the next chapter of our journey, we remain steadfast in our commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI innovation. Meraki Lab is more than just a company; it is a symbol of collaboration, passion, and relentless pursuit of excellence. We are excited to see what the future holds and how our projects will continue to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

<p>One of the key factors contributing to our success has been the invaluable support we have received from patrons across the globe. These patrons have recognized the significance of our projects and have provided the financial backing necessary for their development. We are eternally grateful for their belief in our vision.</p>
