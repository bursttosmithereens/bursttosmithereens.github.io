									<p>Prevent urban flooding during monsoons</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Urban flooding and road water accumulation in particular, arise out of many underlying causes. In cities that are bordered by large water bodies, a capacity overflow can lead to huge spills that can result in urban flooding. Other causes include but are not limited to unclosed landfills, undermanaged drainage systems, excessive unevenness of urban roads etc. The invention UnClog endeavors to help solve urban flooding due to uneven road patterns. The invention utilizes a dedicated drone that takes pictures of historically problematic regions that are highly susceptible to traffic congestion because of road water accumulation.
								<p>UnClog aims to identify areas where waterlogging may take place using convolution computer vision algorithms (CNN) and real-time imaging. A compiled list of flagged locations that are generated can thus help pre-warn the authorities about areas where there is a possibility of water accumulation.</p>
