									Meraki lab was formally established in the summer of 2020 as a sole proprietory initiative. The goal of the lab is to produce creative technical solutions while helping innovators find their footing in the tech world. We use a combination of the most impactful technologies at our disposal, such as artificial intelligence, to craft our products. We currently deal with original, collaborative, and contract-based projects. Our services, at the present time, include the development and the intellectual protection of innovative MVPs. To learn more about our work and discuss potential collaborations, please refer to our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> or email us at contact@merakilab.co.in.

										<h2><a href="#">Cybernation:<br />
										Teach yourself cyber security</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p><center>The cybernation project is a web application that began as a part of Harshita’s internship with the Ministry of Electronics and Information technology. Since then, the team at Meraki has gone on to further enhance its utility. The application is developed purely using Django and Front-End technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and so forth. The sole purpose of the project is to spread awareness about the most prevalent web application attack vectors in Indian Cyberspace. A hackable interface has also been included to help the visitor experience how real-life hacks actually take place. Safe Browsing and internet usage tips are also provided.</p>

									<p><center>PINACC is a women's security provision that was designed during the WiEmpower ideathon organized by the IEEE society's IGDTU chapter. The device is a self-defense injective tool disguised as a hairpin that can help buy women time to escape during a time of crisis. The project was published in the gazette of the Intellectual Property Department of India in November 2020 and is presently in the process of being patented.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">HARP:<br />
										Harshita's Anxiety Reduction Platform</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p><center>HARP proposes the delivery of CBT to the subject via the medium of a simple pac-man game based on a reinforcement learning system. The game will seek to maximize user engagement and thus alter the thought pattern, thereby facilitating the reduction of anxiety levels. The entire project will consist of 4 main components: the IoT sensors, the input handling module, the reinforcement learning system or RLS, and the pac-man game. These components are also the main deliverables of this project. In the end, we hope to arrive at a cheaper but quality alternative to existing expensive EEG hardware, an open-source GUI for real-time EEG visualization, and an RL-driven game.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">UnClog:<br />
										Prevent urban flooding during monsoons</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p><center>The invention UnClog is designed to solve the urban flooding problem caused due to uneven roads. The project employs a dedicated drone that takes pictures of regions that are highly susceptible to traffic congestion because of road water accumulation. Using convolution theorems and computer vision, potholes and unevenness of roads are detected. Further, quantitative operations are applied and the potholes per square meter are estimated. The areas with the largest value of this metric are flagged and a list is compiled. This list can be forwarded to suitable authorities that can then take concentrated preventive measures in time.</p>
