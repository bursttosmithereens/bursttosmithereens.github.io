									Meraki lab was formally founded in the summer of 2020 as a sole proprietorship initiative.
									The vision of the lab is to produce technical solutions that answer to the most pressing of real life challenges.
									We use a combination of the most impactful technologies at our disposal, such as artificial intelligence, to craft our products.
									We currently deal with original, collaborative, and contract based projects.
									Our services, at the present time, include the developement and the intellectual protection of innovative MVPs.
									To learn more about our work and discuss potential collaborations, please refer to our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.

										<h2><a href="#">Cybernation:<br />
										Teach yourself cyber security</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><center>The cybernation project is a web application developed as a part of my internship with the Ministry of Electronics and Information technology. The application is developed purely using Django and Front-End technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and so forth. The sole purpose of the project is to spread awareness about the most prevalent web application attack vectors in the Indian Cyber space. A hackable interface has also been iuncluded to help the visitor experience how real life hacks actually take place. Safe Browsing and internet usage tips are also provided.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><center>PINACC is a women's security provision that was designed during the WiEmpower ideathon organized by the IEEE society's IGDTU chapter. The device is a self-defense injective tool disguised as a hairpin that can help buy women time to escape during a time of crisis. The project was published as a patent by the Intellectual Property Department of India in November 2020.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">HARP:<br />
										Harshita's Anxiety Reduction Platform</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><center>HARP proposes the delivery of CBT to the subject via the medium of a simple pac-man game based on a reinforcement learning system. The game will seek to maximize user engagement and thus alter the thought pattern, thereby facilitating the reduction of  anxiety levels. The entire project will consist of 4 main components: the IoT sensors, the input handling module, the reinforcement learning system or RLS, and the pac-man game. These components are also the main deliverables of this project. At the end we hope to arrive at a cheaper but quality alternative to existing expensive EEG hardware, an open source GUI for real time EEG visualisation, and a RL driven game.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">UnClog:<br />
										Prevent urban flooding during monsoons</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><center>The invention UnClog endeavors to help solve urban flooding due to uneven road patterns. The invention utilizes a dedicated drone that takes pictures of historically problematic regions that are highly susceptible to traffic congestion because of road water accumulation. Using convolution theorems and computer vision, potholes and unevenness of roads are detected. Further, quantitative operations are applied on data obtained by application of convolution algorithms and the potholes per square meter are estimated. The areas with the largest value of this metric are flagged. A list of flagged problem areas can thus be compiled and the suitable authorities can be notified so as to take concentrated preventive measures in time.  </p>
