									<h1>PINACC</h1>
									<p>The womens' security provision</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>PINNAC is a women's security provision that capitalizes on one's instinct to defend to create a protective mechanism. The idea was to develop a security provision for women that could help them protect themselves during times of crisis. PINNAC is an injectable disguised as a hairpin that acknowledges the fact that when one is in danger, the first instinct is to defend. It uses the same drugs that are used to intoxicate and abuse women and turns them into something that can instead help them flee potential attacks. A piston/injection system is hidden inside the prongs of the hairpin, the embellishment being a button. Pushing down on the embellishment removes the security cap and deploys a needle that can then be plugged into the attacker's vital points and renders them immobile within a matter of minutes.
								</p>
								<p>Developed over a period of one year (2019-2020), PINACC was filed for patenting in october of 2020. It has since been published in the gazette of The Department of Promotion of Industry and International Trade, Intellectual Property Office, Government of India (page-172) and the application is currently under consideration. More information on the device can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://hersheysmoxie.wixsite.com/moxie/post/pinnac-click-deploy-defend">here.</a></p>
